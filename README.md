Hey there! I’m Tochukwu – a technical product manager and software engineer with a serious interest for building software that solves real-world problems (and maybe a few imaginary ones too). I'm on the hunt for roles in data or software engineering, development, or management.

If you’re looking for someone to team up with on private or open-source projects, I’m all ears (and keyboards)! Feel free to reach out at tochuks.chris@gmail.com. Let’s make some tech magic happen!
